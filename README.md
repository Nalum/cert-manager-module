This module is applied to these Kubernetes version in CI:

- [![kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/kubernetes-v1.27.11-326CE5?logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white)](https://kubernetes.io)
- [![kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/kubernetes-v1.28.7-326CE5?logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white)](https://kubernetes.io)

## Install

To create an instance using the default values:

```shell
timoni -n cert-manager apply cert-manager oci://ghcr.io/nalum/timoni/modules/cert-manager
```

To change the [default configuration](#configuration),
create one or more `values.cue` files and apply them to the instance.

For example, create a file `my-values.cue` with the following content:

```cue
values: {
    highAvailability: enabled: true

    controller: {
        config: logging: format: "json"
        podDisruptionBudget: minAvailable: 2

        monitoring: {
            enabled: true
        }

        image: {
            tag:    "v1.14.0"
            digest: "sha256:2547fde4e736101abf33f8c2503f12aa3a0b42614d3d64cfecf2835c0ee81c10"
        }
    }

    webhook: {
        podDisruptionBudget: minAvailable: 3
    }

    test: enabled: false
}
```

And apply the values with:

```shell
timoni -n cert-manager apply cert-manager oci://ghcr.io/nalum/timoni/modules/cert-manager \
  --values ./my-values.cue
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall an instance and delete all its Kubernetes resources:

```shell
timoni -n cert-manager delete cert-manager
```

The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.   |

The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.   |

The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.   |

The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.   |

The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.   |

The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.   |

The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.   |

The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.   |

### Recommended values

By default this module is configured for a production deployment and should comply with the restricted
[Kubernetes pod security standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/), any changes
would potentially result in a deployment that doesn't meet these standards.

```cue

    // There are two ways to setup high availability one is to set the replicas in each controller section, another is
    // this shortcut, which defaults to the recommended settings defined here: https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/best-practice/#high-availability
    highAvailability: enabled: true
    // Setting the above true will ignore controller: replicas: etc and use the below
    // highAvailanility: controllerReplicas: 2
    // highAvailanility: webhookReplicas:    3
    // highAvailanility: caInjectorReplicas: 2

    // By default ServiceAccount tokens are not mounted, instead a Volume and VolumeMount are setup to add the
    // ServiceAccount token to the Pod, so here we're reversing that
